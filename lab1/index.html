<div>My name is Sahithi, and I'm from Hyderabad, India. Iâ€™m currently in the 2nd year of my master's program at IIT, focusing on deepening my knowledge in the field. I don't have any experience in web development yet, but I'm eager to explore and learn new skills in that area as I move forward in my studies. </div>
